# 🩺Diabetes_Prediction_Analysis

This project is a **Flask-based web application** that predicts the risk of **diabetes** using **machine learning models**.  
It allows users to input key health parameters such as **Age, BMI, Blood Pressure, Glucose, Insulin, and Family Medical History**, then provides a prediction with a probability score.  
The purpose of this app is to **support early awareness and detection**, but it is **not a replacement for medical consultation**.

# 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a user-friendly web application designed to help individuals assess their likelihood of having diabetes based on medical inputs. It uses a Logistic Regression model to make predictions and provides additional interactive features for a complete user experience.
